    <h><b><i><u>SARAHANA PANDE</i></u></b></h>
    <p>My name is <b>Sarahana Pande</b> and I am currently pursuing a <b>BBA in Entrepreneurship with a minor in CS and DS at Rishihood University</b>. My journey is defined by a deep curiosity for how technology can solve business challenges. While my academic focus is on building the next generation of tech startups. My goal is simple: to build successful startups, achieve independence, and merge my keen knowledge towards /for technology with the discipline I’ve gained through dance. I am striving every day to become a more capable, independent version of myself as I build my future in the tech industry.</p>
